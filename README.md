# Predicting Car Sale Prices for Volvo Vehicles
_A linear regression and data analysis project_

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict car sale prices based on Volvo car listings gathered from Blocket.se. Using a multiple linear regression model, the study explores how variables such as mileage, horsepower, car age, and other categorical features influence the final sale price.

## Methods
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding distributions and relationships
- Outlier removal: Using the IQR method
- Feature engineering: Creating new variables (e.g., car age)
- Model building: Applying multiple linear regression
- Model evaluation: Using R², RMSE, and MAE metrics

## Results
The model achieved an R² value of approximately **0.829**, indicating strong predictive performance. Important predictors included car mileage, age, horsepower, and transmission type.

## Technologies
- R
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `readxl`, `car`, `rsample`, `Metrics`, `GGally`
